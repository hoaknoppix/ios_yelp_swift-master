### Basic Yelp
assignment 2 - week 2

Time spent: Unknown - At least 12 hours. It takes me so long for this. I desired to implement the get direction feature but there is no time left for me. :(

Completed user stories:
Search results page

- [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.

- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.

- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

- [x] Hint: This is just a UISearchBar that is set as the navigationItem.titleView

- [x] Optional: Infinite scroll for restaurant results

- [ ] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results

Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters in the real Yelp App, are supported in the Yelp API.

- [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).

- [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.

- [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch

- [x] Clicking on the “Search” button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

- [x] Optional: Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app

- [x] Optional: Categories should show a subset of the full list with a “See All” row to expand. A formatted list of categories available in the Public API can be found here

- [ ] Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
